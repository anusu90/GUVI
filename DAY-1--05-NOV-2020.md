### Do a write up for the followings:
1. HTTP Version History
2. Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 
3. List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) vs Nodejs
4. what happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser?


### A BRIEF HISTORY OF HTTP?
#### WHY A PROTOCOL?

Protocols are set of rules that guide conversation. Just like humans communications, computers also need such set of rules. What would happen if there are no such rules? Same things happens when lets say two human beings start talking over each other in a language foreign to eachother. Basically resulting in
- Loss of information
- Incorrect information

Thus defeating the purpose. There are many protocols that govern communication between two computers (remember a server is also a computer).
```
- FTP = File Transfer Protocol
- SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- SMB = Server Message Block Protocol 
```

#### WHAT IS HTTP?

HTTP stands for *Hyper Text Transfer Protocol*. So basically it is a set of rules that two computers follow while transferring information over internet.

##### TIMELINE OF HTTP

1. HTTP/0.9
- - This was the initial version of HTTP. Request consisted of a single line and only `GET` method was possible. Since the request lackeed HTTP headers only HTML documents could be transmitted. Similarly there was no provision of status and error codes.
2. HTTP/1.0
- - This version allowed appending version information into the request at the same time idea of HTTP Headers was also introduced. This allowed transfer of metadata bringing in flexibility of transmitting documents other than simple HTML.
- - But these features were not added in a concrete institutionalized way, leading to difficulties in operation. Parallel to this a much more standardized approach was in progress the result of which was HTML/1.1
3. HTTP/1.1
- - 
4. HTTP/2



### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2?





### BROWSER JS(CONSOLE) AND NODE-JS. BOTH HAVE 'JS' - SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

[NODE VS BROWSER](image/Img-node-vs-browser.jpg)

Up until a little over a decade one could only use JavaScript (JS) in browser. This was a serious limitation on the power of JS at same time, made back-end scripting using JS impossible. Ryan Dahl recognized the challenge while updating a progress meter on a web page for uploading files with Ruby web servers in 2009 and created an environment to run JS codes without any browser. Thus **Node-Js** was born. Although both Browser JS (Console) and Node-JS run JS codes there are vital differences
- Browser console does not have access to file system but Node-JS has complete access to system like any other native application.
- Node-JS runs back-end JS codes where as Browser JS (Console) runs front-end JS.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager available for Node-JS something that browsers lack. This allows Node access to thousands of pre-built packages also known as modules.
- window object, document object is absent in Node-JS but is available to Console.
